Joomla CMS user plugin which protects all sensitive user data from being stolen by encrypting them on database level. So when someone finds a dump of your database, or creates this dump when hacking your website, all this information are unusable unless you have the correct key.
This is very useful for websites having huge amount of registered users and don't want these sensitive information to be exposed.
The encryption is more or less transparent, so all 3rd party extensions are allowed to read user tables via SQL queries or API without a problem.
